# S&Box Grass

My attempt at making grass, going quite well but I can't seem to grasp how to make the grass flow more realistically or just better overall as it is basically just random with some other parameters. 

# Includes:
### Frustum culling
### Changing far grass with low LOD ones

------------------------------------------------------
I am trying to improve fps as you lose quite a decent amount of fps when you go full screen you lose about 30-60 fps even with the optimizations, however I am rendering about a million blades of grass and that is realistically you won't ever render that much. 
This project is here for maybe others in the future to look at to know where to start as I had no idea where to start due to the lack of API.


Here are some examples of what it looks like:
